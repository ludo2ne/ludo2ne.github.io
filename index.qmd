Hello! My name is Ludovic Deneuville. I hold a degree from [Polytech'Lille](https://www.polytech-lille.fr/english/){target="_blank"} engineering school, specializing in Computer Science, Microelectronics, and Automation. I'm an [INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil){target="_blank"} agent currently working as a teacher at [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/en/){target="_blank"} (Franceâ€™s Top Graduate School for Statistics and Data Analysis).

I teach various subjects and practical work centered on: Python, SQL, Git, Testing, Code documentation, Java, Big Data.

I like sports, especially volleyball and surfing. I also enjoy running, swimming and hiking. I've been playing chess for a long time (elo rating: 2000), and like to try out different strategies in board games.
